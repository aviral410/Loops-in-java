		What is Loop ?
	</h1>
	<p class="body">
<br><br>
For loop is a programming language conditional iterative statement which is used to check for certain conditions and then repeatedly execute a block of code as long as those conditions are met.
The for loop is distinguished from other looping statements through an explicit loop counter or loop variable which allows the body of the loop to know the exact sequencing of each iteration.
Java provides three ways for executing the loops. While all the ways provide similar basic functionality, they differ in their syntax and condition checking time. </p>

		<p class="body">
	We generally use loop to execute our program with a short source code, it also decreases the chances of error since the lesser part we write the more accurate we are. We can also carry out the function of loops by using the Decision control structure, but for that we have to write the same thing multiple times. The only thing we have to remember while creating a loop is its syntax, if the syntax is wrong the program will not execute. Moreover, we also need to input correct condition and the update statement according to the requirement.

		Different types of Loops
	</h1>
	<p>1. For Loop :<br> <br>First step: In for loop, initialization happens first and only one time, which means that the initialization part of for loop only executes once.<br><br>

Second step: Condition in for loop is evaluated on each iteration, if the condition is true then the statements inside for loop body gets executed. Once the condition returns false, the statements in for loop does not execute and the control gets transferred to the next statement in the program after for loop. 	<br><br>
Third step: After every execution of for loop’s body, the increment/decrement part of for loop executes that updates the loop counter.</p>

<p>2. While Loop: <br><br>
Java while loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition. The while loop can be thought of as a repeating if statement.<br> <br>
Conditional Expression: In this expression we have to test the condition. If the condition evaluates to true then we will execute the body of the loop and go to update expression. Otherwise, we will exit from the while loop.<br> <br>
Update Expression: After executing the loop body, this expression increments/decrements the loop variable by some value.</p>

<h4>Flowchart of While Loop</h4>
<p>I believe that the most difficult and confusing syntax in looping of java is of while loop. To make it more clear I have assigned a video below to make it more clear.</p>

<p>3. Do-While Loop : <br><br>
Do-while loop is similar to while loop, however there is a difference between them:<br><br> In while loop, condition is evaluated before the execution of loop’s body but in do-while loop condition is evaluated after the execution of loop’s body.First, the statements inside loop execute and then the condition gets evaluated, if the condition returns true then the control gets transferred to the “do” else it jumps to the next statement after do-while.</p>
